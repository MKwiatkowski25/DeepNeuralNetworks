# DeepNeuralNetworks
In this repository I have posted my projects for the credit of a course on neural networks. In them I dealt with checkpointing, i.e. optimising memory complexity, transformers and the rainbow algorithm, which is based on DQNs. You can see more about the latter in my Reinforcement Learning repository.
